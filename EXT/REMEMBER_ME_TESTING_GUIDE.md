# Remember Me & Infinite Redirect Fix - Testing Guide

## 🧪 **Quick Testing Steps**

### **1. Basic Remember Me Functionality**

#### Test A: Remember Me ENABLED

1. Open the application in browser
2. Navigate to login page
3. Enter valid credentials
4. ✅ **Check the "Remember me" checkbox**
5. Click "Sign In"
6. **Expected Results:**

   - Login successful
   - Console shows: `🔐 Auth tokens stored in localStorage (persistent)`
   - Console shows: `Remember me: enabled`

7. **Test Persistence:**
   - Close browser completely
   - Reopen browser and navigate to application
   - **Expected:** User should still be logged in
   - **Check Console:** Should show localStorage tokens detected

#### Test B: Remember Me DISABLED

1. Clear all browser data or use incognito mode
2. Navigate to login page
3. Enter valid credentials
4. ❌ **Leave "Remember me" checkbox unchecked**
5. Click "Sign In"
6. **Expected Results:**

   - Login successful
   - Console shows: `🔐 Auth tokens stored in sessionStorage (session-only)`
   - Console shows: `Remember me: disabled`

7. **Test Session-Only:**
   - Close browser completely
   - Reopen browser and navigate to application
   - **Expected:** User should be logged out (redirected to login)

### **2. Infinite Redirect Fix Verification**

#### Test C: No Infinite Redirects with sessionStorage

1. Login without "Remember me" (tokens in sessionStorage)
2. Navigate around the application normally
3. Wait for token to expire (or manually modify token expiration)
4. Try to navigate to protected routes
5. **Expected Results:**
   - No infinite redirects between /login and /dashboard
   - Either smooth token refresh OR proper logout
   - Console shows clear debug messages

### **3. Email Memory Feature**

#### Test D: Email Remembering

1. Login with "Remember me" checked using email: `test@example.com`
2. Logout properly
3. Return to login page
4. **Expected:** Email field should be pre-filled with `test@example.com`
5. **Expected:** "Remember me" checkbox should be checked by default

#### Test E: Email Not Remembered

1. Clear browser data
2. Login without "Remember me" checked
3. Logout
4. Return to login page
5. **Expected:** Email field should be empty
6. **Expected:** "Remember me" checkbox should be unchecked

### **4. Token Refresh Integration**

#### Test F: Refresh with localStorage (Remember Me)

1. Login with "Remember me" checked
2. Wait for access token to expire
3. Make an API call (navigate to a data-heavy page)
4. **Check Console for:**
   - `🔄 401 Unauthorized detected, attempting token refresh...`
   - `✅ Token refresh successful`
   - `💾 New tokens stored successfully in localStorage`

#### Test G: Refresh with sessionStorage (No Remember Me)

1. Login without "Remember me"
2. Wait for access token to expire
3. Make an API call
4. **Check Console for:**
   - `🔄 401 Unauthorized detected, attempting token refresh...`
   - `✅ Token refresh successful`
   - `💾 New tokens stored successfully in sessionStorage`

## 🔍 **Debug Console Monitoring**

### **Expected Console Messages:**

#### During Login:

```
🔐 Auth tokens stored in localStorage (persistent)
Login successful: John Doe
Remember me: enabled
```

OR

```
🔐 Auth tokens stored in sessionStorage (session-only)
Login successful: John Doe
Remember me: disabled
```

#### During Auth Checks:

```
🔍 hasAuthCredentials check: {hasAccessToken: true, hasRefreshToken: true, storageType: 'localStorage'}
✅ User has refresh token - auth credentials available
🔍 getLoggedUserId called
✅ User ID found in token: 123
```

#### During Token Refresh:

```
🔄 401 Unauthorized detected, attempting token refresh...
✅ Token refresh successful
💾 New tokens stored successfully in localStorage
```

## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Infinite Redirects Still Occur:**

1. Check browser console for auth debug messages
2. Verify `hasAuthCredentials()` is being used consistently
3. Clear all browser storage and try again
4. Check if any other auth checks are using `isAuthenticated()`

### **If Remember Me Doesn't Work:**

1. Check browser console for storage messages
2. Verify tokens are in correct storage (localStorage vs sessionStorage)
3. Check if `storeAuthTokens()` is being called with correct `rememberMe` value
4. Inspect browser storage manually (F12 → Application → Storage)

### **If Email Not Remembered:**

1. Check localStorage for `rememberedEmail` key
2. Verify login process calls `localStorage.setItem("rememberedEmail", email)`
3. Check if `getRememberedEmail()` function is working

## 📊 **Storage Inspection**

### **Browser DevTools Check:**

1. Open F12 Developer Tools
2. Go to Application → Storage

#### With Remember Me:

- **localStorage:** Should contain `authToken`, `refreshToken`, `user`, `rememberMe`, `rememberedEmail`
- **sessionStorage:** Should be empty

#### Without Remember Me:

- **localStorage:** Should only contain `rememberedEmail` (if previously saved)
- **sessionStorage:** Should contain `authToken`, `refreshToken`, `user`, `rememberMe`

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

- ✅ No infinite redirects between login/dashboard
- ✅ Remember Me checkbox works correctly
