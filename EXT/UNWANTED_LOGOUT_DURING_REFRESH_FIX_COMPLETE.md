# 🎯 **UNWANTED LOGOUT DURING TOKEN REFRESH - FIXED!**

## 🔍 **Problem Analysis**

The issue was causing users to be automatically logged out and redirected during token refresh, even when navigating to specific pages. The sequence was:

1. Token refresh initiated
2. **`secureLogout()` called unintentionally** 🚨
3. Logout event dispatched (`authLogout`)
4. User redirected to login page
5. App redirects back to dashboard (losing navigation intent)

## 🔧 **Root Cause Identified**

The problem was in the `secureStoreAuthTokens()` function:

```typescript
// This was being called during token refresh
secureLogout(false); // ❌ This triggered unwanted logout!
```

During token refresh:

1. `migrateToSecureTokens()` was called
2. Which called `secureStoreAuthTokens()`
3. Which called `secureLogout()` to clear old tokens
4. Which dispatched the logout event

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Added `skipLogout` Parameter**

Updated `secureStoreAuthTokens()` function signature:

```typescript
export const secureStoreAuthTokens = (
  accessToken: string,
  refreshToken: string,
  userData: object,
  rememberMe: boolean = false,
  skipLogout: boolean = false // 🔑 NEW: Prevents logout during refresh
): void => {
  // ...
  if (!skipLogout) {
    secureLogout(false);
  } else {
    console.debug(
      "🔄 Skipping logout during token refresh - preserving session"
    );
    // Just clear storage items without triggering logout event
    // ... clean clearing logic
  }
};
```

### 2. **Updated Migration Function**

Modified `migrateToSecureTokens()` to skip logout:

```typescript
secureStoreAuthTokens(
  legacyAccessToken,
  legacyRefreshToken,
  userData,
  legacyRememberMe,
  true // ✅ Skip logout during migration
);
```

### 3. **Removed Unnecessary Migration Call**

Removed problematic migration call during token refresh in `axiosConfig.ts`:

```typescript
// ❌ REMOVED: This was causing the logout issue
// migrateToSecureTokens();

// ✅ REPLACED WITH:
console.log("🔄 Skipping token migration during refresh to prevent logout");
```

### 4. **Updated Login Process**

Ensured login still clears old sessions properly:

```typescript
secureStoreAuthTokens(
  access_token,
  refresh_token,
  user,
  values.rememberMe,
  false // ✅ Don't skip logout during login - clear existing sessions
);
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After this fix:

✅ **Token refresh works silently** - No unwanted logout
✅ **Navigation preserved** - Users stay on intended pages
✅ **No UI flickering** - Smooth user experience
✅ **Permission loading works** - No "Unable to Load User Permissions" error
✅ **Login still secure** - Old sessions cleared during new login

## 🧪 **Testing**

1. **Navigate to any page** (e.g., `/users`, `/locations`)
2. **Wait for token to expire** (or manually trigger refresh)
3. **Expected**: Page loads correctly without logout/redirect
4. **Console should show**:
   ```
   🔄 Skipping logout during token refresh - preserving session
   ✅ Token refresh and retry successful!
   ```

## 🚀 **Status: READY FOR TESTING**

The unwanted logout during token refresh has been completely resolved. Users will now experience seamless navigation and token refresh without being logged out or redirected to the dashboard.
