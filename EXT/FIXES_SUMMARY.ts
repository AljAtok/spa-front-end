// Test Summary: Location Management System Fixes

/*
FIXES APPLIED:

1. **LocationTypeManagement.tsx - Fixed infinite loop and data display issues:**
   - Implemented proper data fetching pattern following ModuleManagement.tsx
   - Added proper error handling and loading states
   - Fixed column configuration to use DynamicColumnConfig and mapColumnConfigToGridColDef
   - Added proper API method signatures matching useApi hook
   - Fixed action handlers to follow proper patterns
   - Added proper state management to prevent infinite loops

2. **LocationTypeApi.ts - Fixed API method signatures:**
   - Updated ApiMethods interface to match useApi hook signatures
   - Fixed fetchAllLocationTypes to return LocationType[] directly
   - Fixed toggleLocationTypeStatus to use proper parameter order

3. **CustomDataGrid.tsx - Removed console.log causing loop messages:**
   - Removed console.log that was showing "DataGrid is rendering with rows" repeatedly

4. **Review Steps - Forms already have proper Review Steps:**
   - LocationForm.tsx has proper ReviewLocationStep component
   - LocationTypeForm.tsx has proper ReviewLocationType component
   - Both forms follow ModuleForm.tsx pattern with proper StepComponentProps

5. **Status Radio Buttons Implementation:**
   - Added status radio buttons to both LocationTypeForm and LocationForm
   - Created proper LocationTypeFormValues and LocationFormValues interfaces
   - Implemented proper data conversion between API (status_id) and form (status)
   - Added validation schemas with status field validation
   - Enhanced review steps to display readable status labels

6. **Edit Mode Fixes - COMPLETED:**
   - Fixed TypeScript error with status field type casting (1 | 2)
   - Resolved edit mode blank fields issue through proper data loading synchronization
   - Added dataLoaded state tracking to ensure form renders only after data is loaded
   - Enhanced load functions with proper error handling and state management
   - Added key prop to MultiStepForm for proper re-rendering between create/edit modes
   - Fixed race conditions between form initialization and data loading

7. **TypeScript Errors - All resolved:**
   - Fixed import statements and type definitions
   - Resolved missing state variables and handlers
   - Fixed column mapping and renderer configurations
   - Fixed status field type mismatches in form values

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
✅ LocationTypeManagement should load data without infinite loops
✅ Data grid should display location type rows properly  
✅ Review steps should work in both LocationForm and LocationTypeForm
✅ Status radio buttons work in both create and edit modes
✅ Edit mode populates all fields correctly (LocationTypeForm and LocationForm)
✅ Create mode shows empty fields with proper defaults
✅ Form validation works properly for all fields including status
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Proper API integration following established patterns
✅ Data loading synchronization prevents blank fields in edit mode
