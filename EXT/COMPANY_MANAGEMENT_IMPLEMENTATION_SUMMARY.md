# Company Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented CompanyManagement.tsx and CompanyForm.tsx by replicating the LocationManagement routine and logic. The implementation follows the exact same patterns and structure as the LocationManagement system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Company Types (`CompanyTypes.ts`)

```typescript
export interface Company {
  id: number;
  company_name: string;
  company_abbr: string;
  status_id: number;
  created_at: string;
  created_by: number;
  updated_by: number | null;
  modified_at: string;
  created_user: string;
  updated_user: string | null;
  status_name: string;
  [key: string]: unknown; // For DataGrid compatibility
}

export interface CompanyFormValues {
  company_name: string;
  company_abbr: string;
  status: 1 | 2;
}
```

### 2. Company API (`companyApi.ts`)

```typescript
// API Functions implemented:
- fetchAllCompanies(): GET /companies
- fetchCompanyById(id): GET /companies/:id
- createCompany(data): POST /companies
- updateCompany(id, data): PUT /companies/:id
- toggleCompanyStatus(id, statusId, name): PATCH /companies/:id/toggle-status
```

### 3. CompanyManagement Component

**Features:**

- ✅ DataGrid with company listing from GET /companies
- ✅ Add new company button (navigates to /company-form)
- ✅ Edit company functionality (navigates to /company-form with companyId)
- ✅ Toggle status functionality (PATCH /companies/:id/toggle-status)
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for status changes
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile-hidden fields

**DataGrid Columns:**

- ID
- Company Name
- Abbreviation
- Status
- Created By
- Created At
- Actions (Edit, Toggle Status)

### 4. CompanyForm Component

**Features:**

- ✅ Multi-step form (Details → Review)
- ✅ Create mode: POST /companies
- ✅ Edit mode: PUT /companies/:id
- ✅ Form validation with Yup
- ✅ Pre-population in edit mode
- ✅ Loading states and error handling

**Form Fields:**

- Company Name (required, 2-100 chars)
- Company Abbreviation (required, 2-10 chars)
- Status (Active/Inactive radio buttons)

### 5. Routing Configuration (`App.tsx`)

```typescript
// Added routes:
<Route path="/companies" element={<CompanyManagement />} />
<Route path="/company-form" element={<CompanyForm />} />
```

## API Response Format Handling

### GET /companies Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "company_name": "Bounty Agro Ventures, Inc.",
    "company_abbr": "BAVI",
    "status_id": 1,
    "created_at": "2025-06-16T10:42:30.114Z",
    "created_by": 3,
    "updated_by": null,
    "modified_at": "2025-06-16T10:42:30.114Z",
    "created_user": "Auth Auth",
    "updated_user": null,
    "status_name": "ACTIVE"
  }
]
```

### API Payload Formats

**Create/Update Payload:**

```json
{
  "company_name": "Company Name",
  "company_abbr": "ABBR",
  "status_id": 1
}
```

**Toggle Status Payload:**

```json
{
  "status_id": 2,
  "company_name": "Company Name"
}
```

## Usage Patterns

### Navigation to Company Management

```typescript
navigate("/companies");
```

### Navigation to Create Form

```typescript
navigate("/company-form");
```

### Navigation to Edit Form

```typescript
navigate("/company-form", { state: { companyId: 123 } });
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:

1. **`src/types/CompanyTypes.ts`** - Company interface and form types
2. **`src/api/companyApi.ts`** - Complete CRUD API functions
3. **`src/pages/CompanyManagement/CompanyManagement.tsx`** - Main management component
4. **`src/pages/CompanyManagement/CompanyForm.tsx`** - Add/Edit form component

### Modified Files:

1. **`src/App.tsx`** - Added Company routes and imports

## Pattern Consistency

The implementation follows the exact same patterns as LocationManagement:

✅ **Same file structure and organization**
✅ **Same API patterns and error handling**  
✅ **Same component lifecycle and state management**
✅ **Same DataGrid configuration and actions**
✅ **Same form validation and multi-step structure**
✅ **Same navigation and routing patterns**
✅ **Same confirmation dialogs and user interactions**
✅ **Same responsive design and mobile considerations**

## Testing Checklist
