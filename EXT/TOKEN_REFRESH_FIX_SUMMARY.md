# Token Refresh Mechanism Fix - Complete

## Problem

When the access token expired, users were being logged out immediately instead of attempting to refresh the token using the refresh token. The specific issue was:

1. **Premature logout**: The `isAuthenticated()` function was clearing expired tokens from localStorage
2. **Route protection**: `ProtectedRoute` component was redirecting to login immediately when token expired
3. **Context interference**: `UserPermissionsContext` was setting error state when token expired
4. **No refresh attempt**: The axios interceptor never got a chance to catch 401 errors and refresh tokens

## Root Cause

The authentication flow was designed to be too strict. When a token expired:

1. `isAuthenticated()` would detect expiration and clear the token
2. `ProtectedRoute` would redirect to login before any API calls were made
3. No 401 errors were generated, so the axios interceptor never triggered

## Solution

### 1. **Updated `isAuthenticated()` function**

- **Before**: Cleared expired tokens immediately
- **After**: Logs expiration but doesn't clear tokens (lets axios interceptor handle refresh)

### 2. **Added `hasAuthCredentials()` function**

- More lenient check that returns `true` if user has either:
  - A valid access token, OR
  - A refresh token (even if access token is expired)
- Allows token refresh attempts before forcing logout

### 3. **Updated `ProtectedRoute` component**

- **Before**: Used `isAuthenticated()` (strict check)
- **After**: Uses `hasAuthCredentials()` (allows refresh attempts)

### 4. **Updated `UserPermissionsContext`**

- **Before**: Used `isAuthenticated()` and set error immediately
- **After**: Uses `hasAuthCredentials()` to allow refresh attempts

### 5. **Enhanced axios interceptor**

- Uses `getAccessToken()` instead of `getAuthToken()` to avoid validation
- Properly handles token refresh flow with queuing mechanism

## File Changes

### `src/utils/auth.ts`

- Modified `isAuthenticated()` to not clear expired tokens
- Added `getAccessToken()` function for axios interceptor
- Added `hasAuthCredentials()` function for lenient auth checking
- Enhanced debugging and logging

### `src/api/axiosConfig.ts`

- Updated import to use `getAccessToken` instead of `getAuthToken`
- Enhanced token refresh flow with proper error handling

### `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

- Changed from `isAuthenticated()` to `hasAuthCredentials()`
- Updated import and comments

### `src/contexts/UserPermissionsContext.tsx`

- Changed from `isAuthenticated()` to `hasAuthCredentials()`
- Updated import statement

## Expected Behavior

### When Access Token Expires:

1. User sees the warning: `"Authentication token expired at: [timestamp]"`
2. `hasAuthCredentials()` returns `true` (because refresh token exists)
3. User stays on the protected route
4. Next API call triggers 401 error
5. Axios interceptor catches 401 and attempts token refresh
6. If refresh succeeds: New tokens stored, request retried
7. If refresh fails: User is logged out properly

### Debug Logging:

- Token expiration warnings
- Refresh token availability checks
- Auth credentials status
- Token refresh attempts and results

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Login to the application
2. Wait for access token to expire (or manually modify token expiration)
3. Make an API call (navigate to a page that fetches data)
4. Check console logs for refresh attempt
5. Verify user stays logged in if refresh succeeds

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users don't get logged out unnecessarily
2. **Proper token lifecycle**: Refresh tokens are actually used
3. **Graceful degradation**: Only logs out when refresh truly fails
4. **Enhanced debugging**: Better logging for troubleshooting
5. **Maintainable code**: Clear separation between strict and lenient auth checks
