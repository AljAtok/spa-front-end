// Critical Token Refresh Issue Analysis

Based on the console logs, I can see the following sequence:

1. ‚úÖ Token refresh successful
2. üíæ New tokens stored successfully in localStorage
3. üîÑ Retrying original request with new token
4. ‚ùå GET http://localhost:3000/locations 401 (Unauthorized)
5. ‚ùå GET http://localhost:3000/users/nested/3 401 (Unauthorized)

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is NOT with the token refresh mechanism itself - that's working correctly.
The issue is that even the NEW token is being rejected by the backend with 401 errors.

## Possible Causes

### 1. Token Format Mismatch

The backend might be expecting a different token format than what we're sending.
Current format: `Bearer_c+gi ${token}`
Backend might expect: `Bearer ${token}` or different prefix

### 2. Token Validation Issues

- Backend might not immediately validate new tokens
- There could be a cache or timing issue on the backend
- The new token might not have the correct claims/permissions

### 3. Backend CORS/Auth Configuration

- Backend might be rejecting requests due to CORS issues
- Auth middleware might have additional validation rules

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check actual token being sent in network requests**
2. **Verify backend auth middleware configuration**
3. **Test with manual token refresh outside of axios interceptor**
4. **Check if backend has any token caching or timing requirements**

## Immediate Fix Strategy

Since the reload page works (showing fresh tokens work), the issue is likely:

- Timing: New token needs time to propagate
- Format: Authorization header format issue
- Backend: Server-side validation issue

The fact that reloading works suggests the token itself is valid,
but there's an issue with the immediate retry after refresh.
